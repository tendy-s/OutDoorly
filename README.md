## A tool for exploring national parks in the US


https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/


### Project Description: 
### Write 3-5 sentences on your project topic.
 
This project essentially allows for people to rate and view national parks in the US. Users are able to view information about the park such as activities, amenities and the location. A user will also be given the option to upload reviews with a description, and also upload photos to the gallery.

### Who is it for?
Individuals interested in visiting national parks in the US

### What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?) 
Users submit information regarding their preferences (e.g. activities of choice, US state of choice, etc.) and the app suggests suitable hiking places in the U.S. 
Users provide reviews on their personal experience with different national parks 


### What type of data will it store?
User reviews
User submitted photos
User accounts (potentially)

 
### What will users be able to do with this data? 
Decide on a suitable national park to visit 
Share their national park experience with others
Have national parks recommended based on personal preferences and athletic ability 


### What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?
Smarter filtering based on preferences or amenities 
Marking parks based on popularity

### Project task requirements: 
#### 3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete) 
- User can select preferences (activities, state)
- Users can add their reviews
- Users can submit photos from their visit to the park
- Users can view and click into a list of national park suggestions based on their preferences


#### 3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete) 
- Ability to filter/sort search results
- Show map location of selected park
- Ability to see more detailed info (e.g. fees, hours) regarding each national park 
- Ability to locate parks by amenities offered


#### 2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete at least 1!) 
- Alert users if the park they are in experiences an emergency situation
- Ability to locate parks by proximity
- Popular pictures get shown ahead of others
- User login
- Find national parks that are having events in the next month

### Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks! 
#### This will help you divide up work among your teammates 

#### Users can add their reviews.
- Allow a user to write a review (description) on a park page
- Timestamp reviews once a user submits the review
- Select a star rating out of five.
- Reviews are tagged to the park that they were uploaded to
- Review will be added to the park reviews

#### Users can submit photos from their visit to the park.
- Allow a user to upload an image (or multiple images)
- Allow a user to caption images
- Images are tagged to the park that they were uploaded to
- Image will be added to the image gallery



### Finally, draw 2-3 rough sketch prototypes of some key tasks of your app. Sketch these physically on paper and then scan and add to your repo. (If you’d like to use sketch/prototype software because that’s easier somehow, you can, but we’d advise against it as these prototypes should be low-fidelity (i.e. look bad)).
